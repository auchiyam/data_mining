makefile should compile the whole thing on linux properly through "make" command.  The "lsh" executable should be created, which can be ran to test.

main.cpp is where the main() function is, and it holds a very simple testing sequence I used to test my algorithm.
lsh_cluster.cpp is where all the clustering algorithms are
lsh_search.cpp is where all the searching algorithm are
